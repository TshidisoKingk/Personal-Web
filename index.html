        <h3>Transactional Fraud Detection System Using Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on building a robust fraud detection system that leverages machine learning algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent financial transactions. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques—including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders—the system analyzes transaction patterns to detect anomalies in real-time. The model is trained and evaluated using industry-relevant metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision-recall score, and confusion matrix. This solution aims to enhance financial security and reduce fraud-related losses for institutions.</p>

        <h3> Online Graduation Eligibility System </h3>
        <p>Collaborated with a team to develop a web-based platform that assists lecturers in determining students' eligibility for graduation. The system evaluates academic performance, calculates final grades, and verifies financial clearance status from the student finance office. Built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the solution streamlines the graduation clearance process and enhances administrative efficiency.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3> Real-Time News Title Sentiment Analysis Web Application </h3>
        <p>This project is a real-time web application that analyzes the sentiment of news headlines as they are published. It fetches live news titles using a public news API, processes them using a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face, and classifies each title as positive, neutral, or negative. The backend is built with FastAPI for efficient API responses, while the frontend uses Streamlit for a user-friendly and interactive interface. The system evaluates academic performance, calculates final grades, and verifies financial clearance status from the student finance office. Built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the solution streamlines the graduation clearance process and enhances administrative efficiency.</p>
